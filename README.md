# Machine-learning-project
A project aimed at exploring the fundamentals of machine learning and neural networks and learning about how these algorthythms works and how they can be manupulated.

I will be following this blog: https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/

I will first try to write out the code in Learning.ipynb , then i will try and recreate this algorhithm from scratch to practise. This method was suggested by the blod writer as a way to learn and consolodate this knowledge.

I will start by planning my code using pseuocode in the plan.txt file. then try and build it from scratch.
